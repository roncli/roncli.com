roncli.com
==========

This is the source repository for the [roncli.com](http://www.roncli.com) website.  This website is written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org) using the [rendr](https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr) library.

Projects
========

There are two parts to the roncli.com project.

The first is the SQL Server database, which is encapsulated in a Visual Studio SQL Server Data Tools 2013 project.

The second is the Node project itself, which is developed via PhpStorm.  I do have a Visual Studio Node.js Tools project setup in the solution, but unfortunately Node.js Tools is really buggy right now, and the JavaScript editor is really clunky compared to PhpStorm.  I do not guarantee that the Visual Studio Node.js Tools project will be up to date, except for releases.

Requirements
============

Be sure to have [Visual Studio 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com) with [Node.js Tools for Visual Studio](http://nodejstools.codeplex.com). and node.js 0.10.36 or later installed with npm.

Database Setup
==============

To setup the database, make sure you have Microsoft SQL Server installed.  I use 2014, but I imagine any version will work.

1. Create an empty database.
2. Open the Visual Studio solution.
3. Right click on the database project and do a Schema Comparison.
4. Press the Compare button to start the comparison.
5. Press the Update button to update the database with the schema from the database.

Windows Installation
====================

To run the website on Windows, make sure you perform the following steps.

1. Install [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the all-in-one bundle for [GTK+ 2.x x86](http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip) or [GTK+ 2.x x64](http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip).
3. Unzip the GTK+ 2.x directory to c:\GTK.  It is important that the files are in this directory, as that is where the canvas npm package will be looking for it.
4. Add the c:\GTK\bin\ directory to your system PATH.  (This may require a restart.)
5. From an admin command prompt, install node-gyp and grunt-cli globally:

        npm install -g node-gyp grunt-cli

6. Install the windows build tools globally:

        npm install -g --production windows-build-tools

7. Install the node modules from the /roncli.com directory:

        npm install

8. Add /roncli.com/assets/js/publicConfig.js and /roncli.com/server/privateConfig.js.  See below for file contents.
9. Install the node modules from the /ronc.li directory:

        npm install

10. If using [iisnode](https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode):
    - Point an IIS application to the inner /roncli.com directory
    - Point another IIS application to the /ronc.li directory
    - Run ```grunt``` from the same directory when installing and after every time you change code.
    - Be sure to create the directory "logs" in the root of both of the applications and give the application pools write permission.  For instance, if your application pool is ```roncli.com```, you'll give permissions to the account ```IIS AppPool\roncli.com```.
    - Don't forget to restart the application from within IIS after you run ```grunt```.

    Otherwise, run using a standalone installation by running the following command from within /roncli.com to compile and run the web server:

            grunt all

    If you also wish to run the ronc.li application, run the following command from /ronc.li to run the web server:

            node index.js

Other Installations
===================

1. The roncli.com website requires the [Cairo](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki) library to be installed.  Make sure you follow the Cairo installation instructions for your operating system.
2. From an admin command prompt, install grunt-cli globally:

        npm install -g grunt-cli

3. Install the node modules from the /roncli.com directory:

        npm install

4. Install the node modules from the /ronc.li directory:

        npm install

4. Add /roncli.com/assets/js/publicConfig.js and /roncli.com/server/privateConfig.js.  See below for file contents.
5. Run the following command to compile and run the web server:

        grunt all

    If you also wish to run the ronc.li application, run the following command from /ronc.li to run the web server:

        node index.js

publicConfig.js
===============
The following should be the contents of publicConfig.js:

        window.siteConfig = {
            soundcloud: {
                client_id: "(Your SoundCloud Client ID)"
            }
        };
        
privateConfig.js
================
The following should be the contents of privateConfig.js:

        module.exports = {
